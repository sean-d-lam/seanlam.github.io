                        <p> Hi! My name is <span>Sean Dinh Lam</span>, and I am a <span>first-generation, low-income student</span> looking to 
                            further my education and gain research experience. I am currently a freshman at Colorado College, 
                            where I intend on double majoring in <span>Physics and Computer Science</span>, with an 
                            emphasis in <span>Astrophysics</span>. Although, I am also considering studying <span>Film & Media Studies</span>. Aside from schooling,
                            my daily activities include sports and work. I am a <span>sprinter/hurdler/jumper</span> on the 
                            Colorado College Men's Track & Field Team, and I am a <span>Applied Science Research Intern</span> for the 
                            United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC). My goal is to go into 
                            <span>research/academia</span> with a focus on astronomy or renewable energy.</p>
